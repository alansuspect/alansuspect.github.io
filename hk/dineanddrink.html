					<h2>Seafood</h2>
					<p>It's fried, baked, steamed grilled, sliced and stuffed. More to the point, Hong Kong's seafood is very fresh. So fresh, you can see it swimming minutes before it's on your table. For a truly enjoyable seafood feast, desrt the downtown for a few hours and head for a seafood district.</p>
